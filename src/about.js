Zones of influence represent potential impact on the surrounding environment. For small zones, roads are buffered 50m and logged areas are buffered by 200m. For large zones, roads are buffered by 200m and logged areas are buffered by 500m. The impact fades over time. This is represented on the map as increasing transparency until disappearing after 60 years.";
