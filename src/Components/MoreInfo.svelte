<b>From Intact Natural Forests to Degraded Tree Farms</b>
<br><br>

  The Little Slocan River (LSR) watershed was once cloaked in 
  <em>intact</em> 
  natural forests, the vast majority of which were old-growth forests.
  These forests provided benefits for all life within them, including:

<br>

-   High quality water in modest flows throughout the year. Floods and
    droughts were infrequent, and nearly non-existent.
<br>
-   A moderate climate, with significant capture of carbon i.e.
    sequestration and storage in large trees, multi-layered canopies,
    and carbon rich soils. Big winter snow packs melted slowly in the
    spring, throughout the summer, and into the fall.
<br>
-   Rich biological diversity throughout the above ground forest and the
    soil beneath the ground provided the foundation for a fully
    functioning forested watershed.
<br>
The watershed was in balance. No user of the watershed dominated the
forest. All found what they needed.
<br><br>
The logging history video traces the history of industrial deforestation
of the LSR watershed, as intact natural forests are replaced by
industrial tree farms. Tree farms are not forests. As a result, the LSR
no longer provides the benefits it once did:
<br>
-   Water quality is degraded. Floods and drought are common.
<br>
-   The forest has become a carbon source, exacerbating climate
    disruption.
<br>
-   Biological diversity is degraded, resulting in a loss of species and
    the ecological processes necessary to maintain healthy forests.
<br><br>
The watershed is out of balance. Timber extraction dominates the
watershed. Interfor profits to the detriment of the overarching public
interest that forests provide ecological benefits vital to sustaining
life.

<b>Actual Impact of Logging and Roads—Zone of Influence</b> 
<br><br>
Timber management activities affect ecological processes and population
dynamics well beyond the apparent physical boundaries of access roads
and clearcut blocks. This
<em>zone of influence</em>, or “edge effect,” extends
much farther into the surrounding landscape than is often realized.
Impacts found in the zone of influence include:
<br>
-   habitat loss for species from microscopic soil organisms to large
    mammals, like grizzly bears,
<br>
-   fragmentation of habitats and loss of connectivity,
<br>
-   increased air and soil temperatures,
<br>
-   reduced interception and conservation of water,
<br>
-   drying winds,
<br>
-   spread of invasive plants,
<br>
-   loss of soil moisture,
<br>
-   decrease in nutrient value of forage species, and
<br>
-   decreased benefits from the forest canopy.
<br><br>

Effects from the zones of influence are long lasting. Some habitat
loss may last for a century or more, particularly where old-growth
forest habitat is necessary for persistence of species. The forest
canopies of intact, old forests are complex creating a variety of
habitats in the soil, along the forest floor and up through the
canopy. The forest canopies of tree plantations are very simple and
lack the biological diversity and physical complexity needed for
intact, healthy forests. This is part of the reason that tree
plantations are more flammable and less resilient to climate change
than intact natural forests.
<br><br>
Some species and processes are affected by small zones of influence,
while others are affected by larger zones of influence. For purposes of
this analysis, we have modelled small zones as: roads buffered by 50m
and logged areas buffered by 200m. For large zones, roads buffered by
200m and logged areas buffered by 500m. We have shown that the impacts
fade over time. This is represented on the map as increasing
transparency until disappearing after 60 years, a conservative estimate
of disappearance of zones of influence.
